<h1>Administration User-Interface</h1>

<p><b>Description:</b>The intentions behind this project was to create a reusable administration dashboard that I fully hard-coded myself so I know everything about the interface and how it was set up. In this specific case I used modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript to crete a completely responsive admin dashboard with light and dark mode theme functionality. I used CSS varibles, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Media Queries for responsiness and CSS transtions for smooth animated transations.</p>
